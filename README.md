# online-dating-algorithms
This repository was inspired by several discussions involving the lack of success generated by online dating algorithms.  In this repository, source code for custom dating algorithms will be provided along with explanations regarding why these algorithms fail in the real world.  In addition, any novel ideas that could affect the success rate of these algorithms will also be explored and discussed.  What you are about to read is an editorial/opinion piece from my point of view, which is not without fault.

## Points of discussion:

### 1. Most online dating algorithms are proprietary
Given the lack of dating success stories in this day and age, it's safe to assume that online dating is not targeting audiences that desire long term relationships.  If they are not working, there exists a problem.  Why not make the algorithms open source?  Here are a few possible answers to this question:
- The answer is likely because the company wants to stay ahead of the competition.  Each company does something different to separate itself from the competition.  
- Another possible answer could be that the algorithm is meant to exploit vulnerabilities unique to both sexes, and not to pair them, or not to pair same sex.  When exploiting these individuals, the motive is to keep them on the site.  By doing so, individuals on these dating sites will generate more data.
- Another answer is the combination of the above two points.  If a dating site has a reputation for not working, then it should fail.  However, maybe some of these sites are for hookups, some are for long term relationships, and others appeal to a certain demographic.

### 2. There is not enough in-person, face-to-face interaction
There is no substitute.  Texting is worse than a phone call.  A phone call is worse than a video chat.  A video chat is worse than in-person, face-to-face interaction.  Or, maybe there is a way around this.  What if we had as much data as possible about an individual?  Theoretically, that would help tremendously.
- With texting, miscommunication is very common
- With phone calls, low quality sound and being on the spot without having a face to read makes it uncomfortable
- With video chats, physical presence is still missing
- When face-to-face, the most natural forms of interaction will take their course.

### 3. The dating climate has changed
People are settling down when they have everything going for them.  However, this isn't actually happening.  Hookup culture is in.  Trust issues, fear of repeating the past, astronomical standards, 
- Women are more independent.  This is fantastic but has had some consequences.
- Technology has provided a window to sensitive information about an individual.
  - Say, there is a religious or political difference that acts as an instant deal breaker between two individuals.
- Kids growing up have witnessed a divorce, and don't want to repeat the mistakes of their parents.
- Previous failures in relationships.
- The rise of both crime and social justice.  Yes, sexual crimes are the worst.  Those who can forward with what happened and carry on, are heroes and survivors.  Not victims.  However, lines are easier to cross than ever before.  Say something even slightly offensive, and it's over.  Where is the line exactly?

### 4. Online dating systems always have the same patterns
For both sexes, it's a numbers game, is it not?  These patterns involve the role of the male and female.  
- Men are the pursuers, while females are the selectors.  
- Getting a date is the challenge for men, while getting a good date is the challenge for women.  
- Men seek an ego boost, while women seek validation?  
These are shallow points with some truth.  What about the women who are parents or overweight?  Men who may be dangerous?  Decent men and women exist, and online dating is a difficult place to achieve this.

### 5. Lying
Finally, the reason why the algorithms aren't performing effectively, even if the algorithms were perfect, is because the data is often garbage data.  People lie excessively online, and this lying carries over to online dating.
- Telling the truth, but not all of it.  Have another friend of the opposite sex?  That's not the full story.
- A male saying he is 6' when he is actually 5'8.
- An individual's base salary, job, major, etc.
- Lying about one's self-perceived personality, or even deeper, a dangerous personality disorder.

## Requirements
The following software is required to run the algorithms:
- Python 3
  - Pandas
  - Sklearn
  - Seaborn
